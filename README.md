### Circom circuits for higher degree gates 
- Develop a library for operations of with more than two operands.

### Polygon ZKEVM as rollup on Optimism Bedrock 
- Tweak the polygon ZKEVM in Go with L1 as Optimism Bedrock & deploy the rollup contracts on Optimism to sync it

### ZK Bridge for L2 â€“ L2 transfer using Proof of Burn 
- User burns tokens in Arbitrum & posts the proof of burn in Scroll for the bridge to mint tokens to the user & vice versa

### Confidential Token transfers with UTXO on SC level 
- Implement Private transactions using by creating ZK-Vaults & confidential token transfers using a UTXO model.
- state channel inside the pool itself, UTXO pool on smart contracts , exchange signed anonymous messages

### ECDSA in circom using lookup arguments & custom gates 
- Implement ECDSA with fewer constraints & lesser gates than spartan-ecdsa & circom-ecdsa.
- Update : Personae Labs just implemented this with a lot lesser constraints !!
