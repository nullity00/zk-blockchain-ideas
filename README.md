### Circom circuits for higher degree gates 
Developed a library for operations of with more than two operands

### Polygon ZKEVM as rollup on Optimism Bedrock 
Tweak the polygon ZKEVM in Go with L1 as Optimism Bedrock & deploy the rollup contracts on Optimism to sync it  

### ZK Bridge for L2 â€“ L2 transfer using Proof of Burn 
User burns tokens in Arbitrum & posts the proof of burn in Scroll for the bridge to mint tokens to the user & vice versa

### Confidential Token transfers with UTXO on SC level 
Implement Private transactions using by creating ZK-Vaults & confidential token transfers using a UTXO model.

### ECDSA in circom using lookup arguments & custom gates 
Implement ECDSA with fewer constraints & lesser gates than spartan-ecdsa & circom-ecdsa.
